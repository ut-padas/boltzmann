# Boltzmann deterministic code
- Write-up
- First implementation

# Todo
* Single GPU
  * Solve for series of batched 0d Boltzmann on a single GPU (steady & transient cases)
* Extend Single GPU version to Multi-GPU and Parla Integration
* Finally we can move to spatial coupling if we decided to do so.
